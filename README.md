# Rockmeter

Rockmeter is a custom altimeter for your low or medium power rocket.  
The arduino NANO read the data from a BMP280.  
It gives ALTITUDE + MAX ALTITUDE + TEMPERATURE  
When at least a 5meters is detected the GREEN LED turn RED and a buzzer BEEP.  
The objective was to make a low budget altimeter as you sometimes lose a rocket and you don't want to say bye bye to your 100$ altimeter.

PINNOUT  

RED LED = 9  
Green LED = 10  
BUZZ = 3  
SDA = 4  
SCL = 5  


ADDRESS  

- BMP280 0x76
- OLED 0x3C

** Do not contact me for parts not detected. Usual problem is to check if the address are good in I2C ( USE I2C SCAN) and change the address in original library if needed/

*** Did some test and the unit seems to have a 3% error margin.
